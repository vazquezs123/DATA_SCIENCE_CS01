  3. Report the number of NA's in each column.
  4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
  5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Whichstate has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
  6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
  7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content?
