We started by finding the number of breweries in each state. We determined Colorado to have the most breweries, with D.C., North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia tied for the least with one each. Each state had at least one brewery.

We found 62 ABV values and 1005 IBU values to be missing. We calculated the median ABV and IBU values by state, excluding the missing values from our calculations. We found Colorado to have the beer with the highest ABV, and Oregon had the most bitter beer. Note that South Dakota did not have any reported IBU values.

We found a moderate correlation between ABV and IBU. We found that they have a positive linear relationship, that is, more alcoholic beers tend to be more bitter. We plotted a linear regression model to show how the two measures are related.
