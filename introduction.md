A local beer festival reached out to us asking us to collect and analyze data for various microbreweries in the United States and the beers they make. They want to use this information to choose and purchase representative beers from each state based on their alcohol content and bitterness. They also asked us to find the amount of microbreweries in each state, which will help them determine how many different beers to purchase for each state.

We gathered data which can be found in the data folder of this repository. We found the number of breweries in each state. We then calculated the median alcohol by volume (ABV) and international bitterness units (IBU) of all the beers for each state. Finally, we created a scatterplot and linear regression model to analyze the relationship between ABV and IBU. The R code for our analysis, as well as our interpretation of the results, is available in the .Rmd file located in the repository.

Finally, we created a presentation for our client to communicate our findings. This is available in the repository as a PowerPoint presentation.
